If you need to extract files from a VMware virtual machine disk image file (in VMDK format), thereâs a quick and free way to do it without needing to buy or install VMware Workstation itself. Hereâs how.
 
## First, Install 7-Zip
 
To extract files from a VMDK file without VMWare Workstation, youâll need to download and install our favorite file-extraction tool, 7-Zip. Itâs a highly regarded, open-source program designed to work with compressed and archived file formats. You can get it for free from 7-Zipâs official download page[^1^].
 
**Download File · [https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fblltly.com%2F2uzO26&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0OMM0FOxfOmJtPXJVOEopb](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fblltly.com%2F2uzO26&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AOvVaw0OMM0FOxfOmJtPXJVOEopb)**


 
On the 7-Zip download page, select the file that matches your Windows platform from the list. We recommend downloading the 32-bit or 64-bit version (depending on which version of Windows youâre using) as an EXE file from the latest stable release category listed at the top of the page.
 
Once itâs downloaded, run the 7-Zip installation EXE file in your download location. On Windows 10, you might see a pop-up that reads âWindows Protected Your PC.â If so, click âMore Info,â and then click âRun Anywayâ to bypass the warning. Then, follow the installation steps for 7-Zip listed on the screen.
 
## Next, Open the VMDK Archive and Extract Files
 
Once 7-Zip is installed, locate the VMDK file that you want to extract files from using File Explorer. When you find it, right-click its icon and select â7-Zip,â and then âOpen Archiveâ from the menu. A 7-Zip application window will open. If youâre asked to select a partition, pick one and click âOK.â
 
After that, just below the toolbar, youâll see a list of the files stored inside the disk image. If you need to hunt for a particular file or directory, you can navigate through the folders just like you would in File Explorer.
 
Once you find what youâd like to extract from the VMDK file, select the item (or items) and click the âExtractâ button in the toolbar. 7-Zip will open a âCopyâ dialog window that allows you to browse to the location on your PC where you want to save the extracted files. After youâve selected, click âOK,â and 7-Zip will extract the files to that location. Very easy!
 
Repeat this process as often as needed to recover files from VMDKs, both old and new alike.
 
## Another Method of Opening VMDK Files
 
Although the completely free option above is tempting, if you do have VMWare Workstation Player or VMWare Workstation Pro installed, you have another option for extracting files from a VMDK thatâs fairly easy.

First, locate the virtual disk file in Explorer and right-click it, and then select âMap Virtual Diskâ from the menu. In the window that appears, assign the virtual disk to a drive letter on your Windows PC, and then you can open it in File Explorer and copy files over as you normally would if it were a physical disk.

## How to Create a VMDK File from a Physical Disk
 
If you want to create a virtual machine from a physical disk, you will need to convert the physical disk image to a virtual disk file (VMDK). There are different ways to do this, depending on the tools you have and the operating system you use. Here are some common methods:
 
### Method 1: Use EaseUS Todo Backup
 
EaseUS Todo Backup is a free backup software that can convert a physical disk image to a VMDK file easily. You can download it from EaseUS's official website[^1^]. To use this method, you will need:
 
- A physical disk that you want to convert
- A computer on which to install EaseUS Todo Backup
- A VMware product that can run the VMDK file

Follow these steps to create a VMDK file using EaseUS Todo Backup:

1. Launch EaseUS Todo Backup and click "Tools" -> "P2V Recovery".
2. Select the disk and partition backup image file to convert.
3. Choose the virtual machine name and then select the virtual software vendor: VMware or Virtual PC. Click Browse to modify the location to save the image file.
4. Click "Proceed".

You should now have a VMDK file that can be used to create a virtual machine in VMware.
 
### Method 2: Use VMware Raw Disk Creator
 
VMware Raw Disk Creator is a command-line tool that comes with VMware products. It can create a VMDK file that references a physical disk or partition. To use this method, you will need:

- A physical disk or partition that you want to convert
- A computer on which to run VMware Raw Disk Creator
- A VMware product that can run the VMDK file

Follow these steps to create a VMDK file using VMware Raw Disk Creator:

1. Connect the physical disk or partition to the computer on which you will be running VMware Raw Disk Creator.
2. Launch the VMware product and open a terminal window.
3. Type the following command to create a VMDK file that references the physical disk or partition: `VBoxManage internalcommands createrawvmdk -filename /path/to/file.vmdk -rawdisk /dev/sda` Replace `/path/to/file.vmdk` with the location where you want to save the VMDK file, and `/dev/sda` with the device name of the physical disk or partition. You can also specify which partitions you want to include by adding their numbers after `/dev/sda`, separated by commas.
4. Add the VMDK file to your virtual machine by selecting "Use an existing virtual disk" and choosing the VMDK file you created.

You should now be able to use the physical disk or partition as a virtual machine in VMware.
